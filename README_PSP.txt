BINIAX2PSP v1.0
---------------
This is a PSP adaptation of BINIAX2, a fast-paced puzzle game by Jordan Tuzsuzov (http://www.biniax.com)



GAMEPLAY
--------
Biniax-2 is a game of logic and reaction. The 3 game modes allow you to play against the time,
pure tactical play or challenge with a friend in a multiplayer game.

GAME RULES: The player moves a single element around a field of pairs of elements. You can take a pair if it 
contains your element. When a pair is taken, player's element becomes the other element of the
taken pair. Sometimes the field is scrolling down (the scrolling elements can push you down)
and the goal of the game is to stay as long as possible on the board.
